International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, is proud to present the 15th edition of our annual techno-cultural fest, Felicity'15 from February 20th to 22nd, 2015.
<br/>
Felicity is a one of its kind college festival in India. Here, we concentrate more on value and content rather than glamour and glitz. Our stage is meant as a platform for the deserving rather than a beacon for public attention. Each year, we encourage our audience to explore new fields, think different and challenge the status quo via a variety of events across diverse fields like sports, music, talks, quizzes, programming,dance,etc
